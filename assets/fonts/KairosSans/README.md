# Monotype Variable Font Demo - Kairos™ Sans
 
Monotype is pleased to introduce our first Variable Font demo. Kairos Sans was designed by Terrance Weinzierl and produced by Monotype’s font development team.
 
Kairos Sans is an octagonal sans serif typeface with bold simplicity, with a design influenced by 19th Century Grecian typefaces. It features a full palette of weights and widths; including complementary italics.
 
This Variable Font demo was made to showcase the capabilities in the new OpenType version 1.8 specification. Please read the [EULA], which limits usage for development, prototyping and testing purposes – and not for re-distribution or commercial use.

To test the functionality in this font, try [FontView].
